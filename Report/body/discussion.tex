The network analysis can be used as an indicator of how wide reaching the character information in the different universes is, and how well defined the characters are. The resulting networks clearly show a much larger tendency to clearly defined large networks in the Legends universe, compared to the Canon universe.\\
This result were however not quite mirrored by the word count analysis. The average Canon page length were slightly higher than the Legends pages. This result instead gives the image of the Canon universe being smaller but slightly more detailed.\\
Decision tree classification were the less effective of the two classification methods used. Even though the informative data were reduced by transforming to sentiment score data (thus excluding data from Star Wars specific words such as "Jedi"), the decision tree were still able to classify correctly in most cases. This leads to the realization that there is significant difference between the two universes.\\
Finally the Bayes' classifier showed the same as the decision tree classifier, albeit more clearly. The much more precise classification that the Bayes' classifier were able to do strengthens the claim that there is definitive difference between the Canon and Legends universes.
